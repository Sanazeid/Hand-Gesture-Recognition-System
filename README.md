# Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This project is a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** built with **Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**. It uses a webcam to detect hand landmarks and recognize gestures such as **Like, Dislike, and Peace sign**, then displays corresponding visual icons dynamically on the screen.

The application leverages **MediaPipe Hands** to track 21 hand landmarks and applies gesture logic by analyzing finger positions in real time.
